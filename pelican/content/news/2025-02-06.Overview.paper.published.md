> *Context*. Radio pulsars exhibit a plethora of complex phenomena at the 
> single-pulse level. However, the intricacies of their radio emission remain
> poorly understood.
> 
> *Aims*. We aim to elucidate the pulsar radio emission by studying several 
> single-pulse phenomena, how they relate, and how they evolve with observing
> frequency. We intend to inspire models for the pulsar radio emission and fast
> radio bursts.
> 
> *Methods*. We set up an observing programme called the SUSPECT project running
> at the Nancay Radio Observatory telescopes in France (10--85 MHz, 110--240 MHz, 
> and 1.1--3.5 GHz) and the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) in
> India. This first paper focuses on high sensitivity data of PSR B1822--09
> obtained with the uGMRT between 550 and 750 MHz. The pulsar has precursor (PC),
> main pulse (MP), and interpulse (IP) emission and exhibits mode switching. We
> present its single-pulse stacks, investigate its mode switching using a hidden
> Markov switching model, and analyse its single-pulse morphology.
> 
> *Results*. PSR B1822--09's pulse profile decomposes into seven components. We 
> show that its mode switching is well described using a hidden Markov switching
> model operating on single-pulse profile features. The pulsar exhibits at least
> three stable emission modes, one of which is a newly discovered bright flaring
> Bf-mode. We confirm that the PC and MP switch synchronously to each other and
> both asynchronously to the IP, indicating information transfer between the polar
> caps. Additionally, we performed a fluctuation spectral analysis and discovered
> three fluctuation features in its quiescent Q-mode emission, one of which is
> well known. We conclude that the latter feature is due to longitude-stationary
> amplitude modulation. Finally, we visually classified the single pulses into
> four categories. We found extensive microstructure in the PC with a typical
> duration of 0.2--0.4 ms and a quasi-periodicity of 0.8 ms. There is clear
> evidence of mode mixing. We discovered low-intensity square-like pulses and
> extremely bright pulses in the MP, which suggest bursting.
> 
> *Conclusions*. PSR B1822--09's PC resembles magnetar radio emission, while its MP
> and IP are canonical radio pulsar-like. Hence, the pulsar combines both
> attributes, which is rare. This work introduces several new data analysis
> techniques to pulsar astrophysics.
