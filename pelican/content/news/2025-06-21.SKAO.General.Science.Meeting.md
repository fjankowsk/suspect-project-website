I (Fabian Jankowski) recently presented our work on the [Sub-GHz Radio Pulsar Emission - Lessons Learned and Predictions for SKA](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/73570/submission/803) at the [SKAO General Science Meeting](https://www.skao.int/en/science-users/skao-science-meeting-2025) in GÃ¶rlitz, Germany. This included some of our NenuFAR Pulsar Census results and some work done as part of the SUSPECT project.

Here is a local copy of [my slides]({static}/images/2025-06-21_SKAO_General_Science_Meeting/Jankowski_Fabian_803.pdf) in PDF format.
