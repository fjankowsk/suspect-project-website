I (Fabian Jankowski) recently presented our current work from the SUSPECT project at the [Les Houches conference](https://r-magnetosphere.sciencesconf.org/?lang=en) in the French Alps near Chamonix. The poster introduces the project, gives a brief status report, and shows some results from the first publication. It also mentions some of the current work in preparation.

Here is a local copy of my [SUSPECT pulsar single pulse poster]({static}/images/2025-04-16_Les_Houches_conference/Jankowski_SUSPECT_poster_Les_Houches.pdf) in PDF format.
