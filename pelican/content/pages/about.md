Summary: The SUSPECT project is XXX.

The "Science Using Single-Pulse Exploration with Combined Telescopes" (SUSPECT) project is a multi-frequency multi-telescope radio pulsar observing effort running at the [Nançay Radio Observatory telescopes](https://www.obs-nancay.fr/) (10--85 MHz, 110--240 MHz, and 1.1--3.5 GHz) in France and the [upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT)](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/gmrt) in India. The Nançay Observatory telescopes include NenuFAR, the French LOFAR station FR606, and the Nançay Radio Telescope (NRT).

In this project, we study the multi-frequency radio emission of pulsars, which are rapidly rotating and highly magnetized neutron stars. In particular, we focus on understanding their wideband single-pulse emission.
